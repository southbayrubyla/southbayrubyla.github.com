title: South Bay Ruby Developers | About

<div id="home">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the South Bay Ruby Developers study group website! We meet every other Thursday to discuss our current Ruby Programming related title. Usually, we'll read through about one chapter to prepare for each meetup.</p>

  <p>Previously, some of us started a group called South Bay Ruby LA (the name was to disambiguate ourselves from the Nothern California "South Bay"). Since the meetup.com group was started however, we've been going by the name South Bay Ruby Developers.</p>

  <p>You can get in touch by visiting the meetup group link at the top or if you prefer, send an email to southbayrubyla at gmail.com and we'll get back to you as soon as possible with current info about our meetup time and current reading. Come join us!</p>
