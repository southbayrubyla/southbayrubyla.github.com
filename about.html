  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the SouthBay Ruby LA study group website. We are a group of developers and enthusiasts dedicated to studying the art of the Ruby programming language (including Ruby on Rails). We are an offshoot of the LA Ruby Pasadena study group with members from the SouthBay region, but also Long Beach and parts of Orange County. We meet regularly once a week to discuss readings, practice coding, and to plan/do projects.</p>
